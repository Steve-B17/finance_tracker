# Finance Tracker

## Overview

Finance Tracker is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help individuals keep track of their income and expenses over time. By inputting transactions into a CSV file, users can easily monitor their financial health, identify spending patterns, and make informed decisions about their finances.

## Features

- **Transaction Logging**: Easily log income and expenses with details such as date, amount, type, and category.
- **Data Visualization**: Although not implemented yet, future updates aim to include visual representations of your financial data to better understand your spending and earning trends.
- **Custom Categories**: Users can define custom categories for both income and expenses, allowing for a personalized tracking experience.
- **Data Integrity**: The system is designed to handle various data inconsistencies and ensure your financial data remains accurate and reliable.

## Getting Started

To get started with Finance Tracker, you'll need to have a basic understanding of how to work with CSV files. The project does not require any specific software installation beyond a text editor or a spreadsheet program to view and edit the `finance_data.csv` file.

### Prerequisites

- Any text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Notepad++) or spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets).

### Usage

1. Running a Python project from GitHub involves a few standard steps. Here's a concise guide to get you started:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project and run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Once cloned, navigate into the project directory using the `cd` command:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory where the repository was cloned.

3. **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**: It's a good practice to set up a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. If you're using `venv`, you can create and activate it like this:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Next, install the required dependencies for the project. Typically, you'll find a `requirements.txt` file in the project which lists all dependencies. Install them using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If there's no `requirements.txt`, check the project's `README` or documentation for specific instructions on installing dependencies.

5. **Run the Project**: Once dependencies are installed, you can run your Python project. Look for a main script file or follow the instructions provided in the project's documentation. Common commands to run Python scripts are:

   ```bash
   python <script-name>.py
   ```

   Replace `<script-name>` with the actual name of the main script file.

6. **Testing**: If the project includes tests, it's good practice to run them to ensure everything works as expected. Tests are usually found in files or directories named `test` or `tests`.

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

   Adjust the command if your project uses a different testing framework.

7. **Contributing (Optional)**: If you plan to contribute to the project, follow any guidelines provided in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or the project's repository. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run most Python projects hosted on GitHub. If you encounter specific issues or errors, refer to the project's issue tracker or community forums for help.
